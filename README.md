# Disease Diagnosis Prediction using Gradient Boosting

This project builds a predictive model for disease diagnosis (e.g., diabetes) using the PIMA Diabetes Dataset and Gradient Boosting Classifier. It is designed to help in early detection and prevention of diseases based on medical features.

## Model Used
Gradient Boosting Classifier
Feature Scaling: StandardScaler
Metrics: F1 Score, AUC-ROC

## Output
ROC Curve
